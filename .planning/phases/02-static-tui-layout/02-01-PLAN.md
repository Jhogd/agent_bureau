<objective>
Add textual as a pinned runtime dependency in pyproject.toml so that all subsequent Phase 2 implementation tasks can import from textual without a separate install step.

Purpose: Textual is not yet listed in pyproject.toml `[project] dependencies`. Every widget, app, and test in Phase 2 imports from textual. This must be in place first.
Output: Updated pyproject.toml with `"textual>=0.80.0,<9"` in the `[project] dependencies` list.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Pin textual dependency in pyproject.toml</name>
  <files>pyproject.toml</files>
  <action>
Edit pyproject.toml and add `"textual>=0.80.0,<9"` to the `[project] dependencies` list.

Current state: `dependencies = []`
Target state: `dependencies = ["textual>=0.80.0,<9"]`

CRITICAL: Do NOT use `>=0.70.0,<1.0` — that pin appears in the roadmap decision log but is wrong. Textual is now at 8.0.0. The `<1.0` upper bound would resolve to pre-release alphas or fail entirely. The correct pin is `>=0.80.0,<9` which locks to the current 8.x major version.

After editing pyproject.toml, run:
```
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```
from the project root (`/Users/jakeogden/agent-bureau`) to install textual and verify the dependency resolves correctly.

Then run:
```
python -c "import textual; print(textual.__version__)"
```
to confirm textual is importable and the version starts with `8.`.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run from /Users/jakeogden/agent-bureau:
```
pip install -e '.[dev]' && python -c "import textual; print(textual.__version__)"
```
Output must show a version starting with `8.` (e.g., `8.0.0`).
  </verify>
  <done>pyproject.toml contains `"textual>=0.80.0,<9"` in `[project] dependencies`, and `import textual` succeeds with version 8.x.</done>

<verification>
- `grep "textual" /Users/jakeogden/agent-bureau/pyproject.toml` shows `textual>=0.80.0,<9`
- `python -c "import textual; print(textual.__version__)"` shows version 8.x
- `python -c "from textual.app import App; from textual.widgets import RichLog"` succeeds without ImportError
- Existing tests still pass: `pytest /Users/jakeogden/agent-bureau/tests/ -q`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
textual 8.x is installed and importable. pyproject.toml is the authoritative declaration. Existing tests continue to pass.
</success_criteria>
